    <p>Intermediate codes are machine independent codes, but they are close to machine instructions. The given program in a source language is converted to an equivalent program in an intermediate language by the intermediate code generator.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The designer of the compiler decides the intermediate language.</li>
        <li>Syntax trees can be used as an intermediate language.</li>
        <li>Postfix notations, three address code (quadruples) can be used as an intermediate language.</li>
    </ul>

       <span class="normal-heading"><strong>Syntax Tree</strong></span>
       <p> Syntax tree is a variant of the parse tree, where each leaf represents an operand and each interior node represent an operator.
    </p>

    <span class="normal-heading"><strong>Three-Address Code</strong></span>
    <p>When each statement contains three addresses (two for operands and one for result), Most general kind of three-address code is</p>
    <p class="examples">x = yop z</p>
    <p>Where x, y and z are names, constants or compiler generated temporaries and op is any operator.</p>
    <p>But we can also use the following notation for quadruples (much better notation because it looks like a machine code instruction)</p>
    <p class="examples">Op y, z, x</p>
    <p>Apply operator op to y and z and store the result in x.</p>
    <span class="normal-heading"><strong>Representation of Three-Address Codes</strong></span>
    <p>Three-address code can be represented in various forms i.e., quadruples, triples and indirect triples. These forms are demonstrated by way of examples below.</p>
    <p class="examples">e.g., A = - B*(C +0)</p>
    Three address code is as follow
    <pre>
    T1 = - B
    T2 = C + D
    T3 = T1* T2
    A = T3
    </pre>
