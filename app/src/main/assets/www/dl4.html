    <p>In sequential logic circuit, the output is dependent upon the present inputs as well as the past inputs and outputs.</p>
    <div class="full-width"><img class="full-width-image" src="images/dl41.png" alt=""></div>
    <p>Sequential circuit is of two types.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Synchronous Sequential Circuit: </b>Change in input signals can affect memory elements only upon activation of clock signals.</li>
        <li><b>Asynchronous Sequential Circuit: </b>Change in input signals can affect memory elements at any instant of time. These are faster than synchronous circuit.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Flip Flops:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>It is a one-bit memory cell which stores the 1-bit logical data (logic 0 or logic 1).</li>
        <li>It is a basic memory element.</li>
        <li>The most commonly used application of flip flops is in the implementation of a feedback circuit.</li>
        <li>As a memory relies on the feedback concept, flip flops can be used to design it.</li>
        <li>In synchronous sequential circuit, Memory elements are clocked flip flops and generally edge triggered.</li>
        <li>In asynchronous sequential circuit, Memory elements are unclocked flip flops / time delay elements which are generally level triggered.</li>
        <li>Flip flop circuit is also known as bistable multivibrator or latch because it has two stable states (1 state, 0 state).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are mainly four types of flip flops that are used in electronic circuits.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>S-R Flip Flop (Basic Flip Flop)</li>
        <li>Delay Flip Flop (D Flip Flop)</li>
        <li>J-K Flip Flop</li>
        <li>T Flip Flop</li>
    </ul>
